[**DynDream**](https://github.com/shang-lin/dyndream) &mdash; This Python program lets you
use your Dreamhost account and your own subdomain to manage your dynamic IP address.

[**OpenGL experiments**]({{site.baseurl}}/gldemos) &mdash; I created a series of OpenGL demos of animation and texture mapping as a project for [CS 11](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/). 

[**Sorting and Searching Strings (CS20c)**](cs20/) &mdash; This was my project for [CS20c](https://web.archive.org/web/20010721115256/http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~cs20/) at Caltech. I compared the time complexities of 
implementations of binary and ternary trees in Lisp.
