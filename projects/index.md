[**DynDream**](https://github.com/shang-lin/dyndream) &mdash; This Python program lets you
use your Dreamhost account and your own subdomain to manage your dynamic IP address.

[**OpenGL experiments**]({{site.baseurl}}/gldemos) &mdash; I created a series of OpenGL demos of animation and texture mapping as a project for [CS 11](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/). The Github repo is [here](https://github.com/shang-lin/gldemos). 

[**Sorting and Searching Strings (CS20c)**](cs20/) &mdash; This was my project for [CS20c](https://web.archive.org/web/20010721115256/http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~cs20/) at Caltech. I compared the efficiency of binary search trees,
digital tries, and ternary search trees in Lisp. This project was based on
the paper "Fast Algorithms for Sorting and Searching Strings" by Jon L. Bentley and Robert Sedgewick.
