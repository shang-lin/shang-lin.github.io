title: Shang-Lin Chen - Official website
---

**W**elcome to my official website! My name is Shang-Lin Chen (first name Shang-Lin), and you have reached the right place to learn more about me.

I originally hail from the Midwestern United States. After living in three time zones, I graduated with a degree in computer science from [Caltech](http://caltech.edu). Officially, my degree is in Engineering and Applied Sciences because that is what Caltech offered at the time as an undergraduate option for computer science. I now work with Linux servers and programming for money. 

More information about my past and present technical projects is available on [my projects page]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/).

I also spend my time doing [tai chi chuan](http://taijichuan.org) and [dancing]({{site.baseurl}}/dance/).
