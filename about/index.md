**About Me**

Who am I?

My (first) name is Shang-Lin. I consider myself to be from California, but I hail from from the Midwestern United States, via the East Coast. I work as a software developer / Linux systems administrator, and my interests include languages (both natural and programming), dancing, tai chi chuan, and reading. In my spare time I enjoy taking [MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course). 

Despite failing kindergarten, I was good at school. I have a degree from [Caltech](http://caltech.edu) in Engineering and Applied Sciences. I would have majored in Computer Science if Caltech had offered it as a major back then. After surviving the infamous Caltech core curriculum, I took courses that included computation, algorithms, object-oriented programming, computer graphics, Spanish, French literature in translation, Chinese, medieval history,political science, financial law, and ping pong.

A mirror of my [original Caltech website](http://shangril.freeshell.org/its/) is still online.
