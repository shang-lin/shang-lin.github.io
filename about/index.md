I'm originally from the Midwestern United States, but now I live in California, via the East Coast. 

Despite basically failing kindergarten, I was good at school and have a degree from [Caltech](http://caltech.edu) in Engineering and Applied Sciences. I would have majored in Computer Science if Caltech had offered it back then. 

At Caltech, I survived the infamous core curriculum and took courses in computation, algorithms, object-oriented programming, computer graphics, Spanish, French literature, Chinese, and ping pong. 

I now do a mixture of software development and Linux administration for work. In my spare time, I like taking [MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course), doing tai chi, or [dancing]({{site.baseurl}}/dance/).
