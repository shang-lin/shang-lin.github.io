Google Pacman
-------------

This is a copy of Google's playable Pacman game logo hosted for
Pacman's 30th Anniversary.

With the help of StackOverflow users, we were able to get a playable
version working.

To play a live version: http://macek.github.com/google_pacman/

Or download the source and run it offline.





Confusion Surrounding Audio Bug
-------------------------------
When this repository was originally created, Google was using:
  
  logos/js/pacman10-hp.2.js
  logos/pacman10-hp-sprite.png

They have since updated to:

  logos/js/pacman10-hp.3.js
  logos/pacman10-hp-sprite-2.png

As you can see, the new sprite features a mute button. Those playing on
a webserver should have a fully functioning game now. However, music
and sound do not work when playing locally.



@winwakr found this fix for the time being:

A snippet from Adobe.com

    For example, a trusted local HTML file may permit an untrusted local
    SWF to script it by setting allowScriptAccess="always". However, an 
    untrusted local HTML file may never permit an untrusted local SWF to
    script it, regardless of the value of allowScriptAccess.

To have flash trust your local SWF, you must add your `google_pacman`
folder to the allow list using your Flash Control Panel.
  
  1. Adobe Flash Control Panel:
     http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html
  
  2. Click `Edit Locations`
  
  3. Click `Add Location`
  
  4. Browse to your `google_pacman` directory
  
  5. Click `Add`

Wishlist
--------
1. Get sound working (when playing locally)
