<!-- <p>I started dancing in 2006 with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2299673497/">salsa classes</a>. Since then, I've tried many partner dance styles to varying extents, but I mainly specialize in <a href="http://www.caltechdance.org/swing">West Coast swing</a> and <a href="http://www.caltechdance.org/home">ballroom and Latin</a>. 
	</p>
	
	<p>I've compiled a list of online dance communities and resources and Los Angeles/Orange County social dance venues and dance stores.</p>
